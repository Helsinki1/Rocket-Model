# Rocket-Model
Over the Winter break of 2020, I designed a rocket, about 30cm long, with a parachute deployment system. The entire body of the rocket was 3D printed using PLA from my personal CoreXY printer. The rocket was propelled using an ESTES B6-4 black powder engine, and the parachute was custom made using a standard trash bag and string. The parachute was folded into a small triangle shape and oiled to allow for it to be easily unraveled once the rocket starts to fall back down. The launch was successful, with the parachute deploying as expected. The rocket was retrieved afterwards in a good enough condition to be reused.
